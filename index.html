                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <p>This week, in a Variety profile, Kim Kardashian thought she was giving women of the world invaluable advice on how to succeed in business. “I have the best advice for women in business,” Kardashian told Variety. “Get your fucking ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.” Unfortunately, this advice was not taken kindly by a majority of women who are overworked, underpaid, and, in many ways, simply exhausted. So yes, Kim — nobody wants to work because we are all tired of working every single day, for people like her, who get to reap the profits of our labor.</p>

                    <p>Bans on healthcare for trans youth are passing throughout the country. So are bans on trans participation in youth sports, and the acknowledgement of queer people’s existence in classrooms. Until now, I haven’t had the will to write about any of it. Hell, for weeks I could barely bring myself to read very much about these statutes.</p>

                    <p>It’s a touchy-feely thing, urban cycling. It’s physical, organic and a feast for the senses. I’m sure the spandexy dudes get all sensory on their fancy bikes as they measure their watts or whatever they do, but this is about the Five Urban Cycling Senses in a bicycle-friendly city where your bike is your fifth limb — and all the inherent poetry involved in that</p>
